## Description

The VisualScript is an attribute created for JetBrains Rider to make methods used by Unity's visual scripting known to
the IDE. 

> **Info**: Beyond its common goal of aiding the IDE, this attribute also preserves the method from being stripped by
> Unity's automatic stripping of unused code.
